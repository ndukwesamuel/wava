                <h5> You've likely been burned before by an online program. Maybe it was a course that didn't deliver on its promise, or a workshop that turned out to be a thinly-veiled sales pitch.</h5>

                <h5>
                    And while we can tell you that Mini Workshop Magic is well, magical (and it is), there's nothing that replaces hearing from actual buyers.

                            <p>hey, i'm sarah</p>

                            <p> A couple years ago, my copywriting business was thriving, but I was not. </p>

                            <p> Most days, I felt like I was running in circles: posting social media content, chasing down leads, spamming FB groups in the name of networking, and taking sales calls. And then, after all that: burning the midnight oil just to stay on top of stressful client deadlines.</p>

                            <p> My goal? To sell more of my VIP Day packages (‘cause those were super fun and easy to deliver) while spending less time actually selling.</p>

                            <p> On a whim, I launched my first-ever paid workshop. I wanted to rewrite my email nurture sequence, so I invited people to watch me live-write it (and promised to give them templates and tips so they could get their own sequence done in a single afternoon, too).</p>


                            <p> It sold out in 48 hours, gave me an unexpected $10k payday, and created multiple connections that turned into long-term clients. Win-win-win.</p>

                            <p>
                                Since then, I’ve sold copywriting workshops ranging from $47 to $2499. And I’ve turned those workshop relationships into client contracts worth as much as $36,000 (no sales calls needed).
                            </p>

                            <p> 
                                For me, those big client deals aren’t even the best part. The best part is that Mini Workshops have given me more freedom inside my business. If there’s a month where I want to take on less client work or juggle fewer projects, I just run a workshop instead.
